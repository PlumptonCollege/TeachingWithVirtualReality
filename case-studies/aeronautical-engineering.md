## Identifying airplane parts for Aeronautical Engineering
### Greater Brighton Metropolitan College

The aeronautics workshop at GBMC contains a large selection of specialist equipment that students need to become familiar with in a short period of time. The team saw the potential to take immersive 360o videos of tools and part in operation as both a student induction activity and as a regular refresher throughout their programme.

Each tool or part was capture by the learning technology team and current students. Wide-angle photos of the workshops, garages and other practical areas were also captured. All of this content is currently being put into a virtual tour using ThingLink.

Like with previous trials, the biggest challenge was getting the virtual tours to work effectively on virtual reality headsets. Head-mount VR has limited interactivity. Since the virtual tour was designed for browsers, the resources worked better as an immersive website accessed from the colleges digital classroom.
