For this case study, the ESCG wanted to create a resource that allowed users to explore the carpentry machine workshop. Collaborating with the lead carpentry lecturer, the innovation team chose a selection of machines that included a mix of those students would use as part of their course of study, and some that were only part of a level 3 course of study. For capture they used a Theta V VR camera to capture the photographic content, and to record 360 demonstrations of the machines in use.

The team discovered while producing the content that it was possible to capture a large enough field of view of the workshop that only two 360 photos were needed. These were linked using the VR tour software 3D Vista, and the video content was then embedded into the resource. This was then uploaded to our servers to be shared. We discovered however that standard web servers do not support the correct video codec for 360 videos, so these were not displaying correctly. Instead, the videos were each uploaded to YouTube and shared.

They tested out two formats when showing the resource to our students. First, they displayed the full resource on the large screen TV in carpentry’s main work space. Secondly, they provided several VR headsets to try out the virtual look around of the machine shop minus videos, as the teacher was unable to get VR mode on YouTube to work on the student’s mobile phones.

“I like seeing (the machine shop) clean!” was one of the first responses. On speaking to the lecturer, after the demonstration the team agreed that showing a “best practice” example of how to leave workspaces was a welcome unexpected bonus of the resource.

“It’d be cool to still have this after I leave to remind me how to do things.” This student was very happy to hear that the link to the resource would still work for them after they left the college, and also liked that it showed them a trusted first look at how to use the machines they hadn’t been able to use properly.

“Getting to see (the machine shop) more is good, get used to the room.” This student was referring to the fact students don’t spend a huge amount of their course in this workspace, and went on to say they would feel “safer” being able to familiarise themselves with the space before using it.

“(This is a) more fun way to revise stuff than reading about it.” This was a sentiment a few of the students shared. They liked being able to “explore” instead of just passively looking at documentation on its own.

Some students were nervous about using the headsets in front of their peers. There was an anxiety of “looking silly”, but gradually the teacher encouraged most of the group to try it.

The lecturer was happy with the potential of the resource, but wants now to start to add more substantive content like health and safety manuals, and hopes to set it as a flipped learning homework task accompaniment in the future.
