## Showcasing Students Work for Prop-making
### Greater Brighton Metropolitan College

For their final trial, GBMC wanted to see how virtual reality could be used to showcase students work for their portfolio of evidence. Students on the Prop Making course created a wide variety of products for their end of year show. The teaching team could see the potential of using 360o photography to capture as much detail as possible from the work and to present all of the items in an engaging way to remote viewers.

Students used 360o cameras to take pictures of their work. They also created an individual blog describing their working method. The learning technology team at GBMC then took these materials and are currently building a virtual tour where the user could explore all of the items and link through to the studentsâ€™ blogs and other resources.
Like with their other trials, the biggest challenge was getting the virtual tours to work effectively on virtual reality headsets. The resources worked better as an immersive website accessed from the colleges digital classroom.

Like with previous trials, the biggest challenge was getting the virtual tours to work effectively on virtual reality headsets. Head-mount VR has limited interactivity. Since the virtual tour was designed for browsers, the resources worked better as an immersive website accessed from the colleges digital classroom.
