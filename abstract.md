Emerging technologies like 360° photography, video, augmented and virtual reality could have the potential to allow teachers to use digital environments in there practice in order to enhance and accelerate their student’s learning. Entry-level immersive technology has reached a price and complexity point where it is now accessible to the average classroom, but how can a teacher effectively integrate these technologies within their lessons?

In 2018, as part of the Education & Training Foundations' Outstanding Teaching Learning & Assessment grant programme, a partnership of Sussex Colleges explored the effective use of immersive technologies in the classroom. The project evaluated the impact that different technologies had on various teaching and learning activities, including orientation tasks, knowledge retrieval and skills acqusition. 

The most positive evaluations from students and teachers came from using 360° photography and video to immerse students in both new and familiar learning situations. Although skills acquistion tasks were suited to full-room virtual reality technology with interactivity, they proved to be the least accessible activities for the average classroom. The technology that had the greatest net impact on teaching & learning was all-in-one mobile virtual reality combined with prepared 360° video. 

The partnership will be publishing ten case studies of teaching with virtual reality and an online best practice guide at: https://www.teachingwithvirtualreality.com.
