Before commencing teaching trials, it was important to identify areas where the partners believed immersive technologies could have an impact within the classroom. The project identified four areas for evaluation.

‘Instruction or Orientation’ describe activities where students experience a learning environment or skill for the first time. Virtual reality could be a way of introducing students to a new learning area before they are physically able to in the real world.

‘Knowledge Retrieval’ describes tasks designed to test students’ recall of previous learning. After a student has been introduced to new knowledge or skill, experiencing similar situations again through immersive technology may help to deepen and accelerate long-term learning.

In a ‘Practical Application’ exercise a student demonstrates skills or knowledge they have developed during a teaching programme. This goes beyond ‘Knowledge Retrieval’ as students will be actively applying skills they have learnt in a virtual environment.

Finally, in an ‘Assessment’ activity a student would be required to prove competence in a learning area. An examination could take place through a virtual reality environment, or a captured scene demonstrating a student’s mastery of a learning criteria could be used as evidence within a portfolio.
