In 2018, as part of the Education & Training Foundations' Outstanding Teaching Learning &; Assessment grant programme, a partnership of Sussex training providers in the United Kingdom explored the effective use of 360Â°, augmented and virtual reality technologies within the classroom.

Entry-level immersive technology has reached a price and complexity point where it is now accessible to the average classroom, but how can teachers effectively integrate these technologies into their lessons? The partnership sought to answer this question as well to meet the three main aims of the project:
* Evaluate different types of immersive technology and content in the classroom.
* Evaluate the impact of the technology on different types of learning activities.
* Publish example content and a framework of best practices for other colleges.

This website - Teaching with Virtual Reality - is designed as a guide for other practitioners on how to use virtual reality in their own teaching.
