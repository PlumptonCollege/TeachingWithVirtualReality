The lead organisation for this project was Plumpton College, a specialist land-based further and higher education provider based in the South Downs near Lewes. The college has over 1500 further education students. The project was led by James Michael Maltby, Learning Technology Manager within Teaching & Learning. Case studies were led by Michael Danks.

The second main partner was Greater Brighton Metropolitan College (GBMC) which is a recent merger between Brighton Metropolitan and Northbrook College in Worthing. The college is a general further and undergraduate education provider with over 3500 16-18 year old students. The case studies at GBMC were led by Marion Harrison, Rachael Thomas and Jonathon Vernon.

The third main partner was East Sussex College Group which is a recent merger between Sussex Downs in Eastbourne/Lewes and Sussex Coast College in Hastings. The college is a general further education provider with over 5000 full-time students. The case studies at ESCG were led by Kevin Jones and Sam Shuttleworth.

Finally, the e-learning teams at the University of Brighton and Sussex were invaluable in providing technical support to the partnership and helping to evaluate the higher education potential of this project. Particular thanks to Daniel Axon at Sussex University, Katie Piatt and Nick Feather at Brighton University.
